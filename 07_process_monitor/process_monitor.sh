#Create a script called process_monitor.sh that monitors specific processes and can automatically restart them if they're down. 
#What You Need to Implement: Monitor multiple processes from a configuration file Check if processes are running by PID or name 
#Automatic restart capability for failed processes
#Email/log alerts when processes fail Process resource monitoring (CPU, memory usage) 
#Daemon mode - run continuously in background Requirements: Read process list from processes.conf file 
#Send alerts when processes fail or are restarted

#Example configuration file: process.conf
# Format: process_name|restart_command
#nginx|sudo systemctl restart nginx
#sshd|sudo systemctl restart sshd
#myapp|/usr/local/bin/myapp --start


#!/bin/bash
# Configuration
CONFIG_FILE="processes.conf"
LOG_FILE="/var/log/process_monitor.log"
SLEEP_INTERVAL=60   # seconds between checks
ALERT_EMAIL="admin@example.com"

# Function: log messages
log_msg() {
    echo "$(date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S') - $1" | tee -a "$LOG_FILE"
}
#This function will output ex:2025-09-03 17:45:12 - Process nginx is running
#tee -a sends this message to the terminal as well appends into the LOG_FILE

# Function: send email alert
send_alert() {
    SUBJECT="Process Alert: $1"   # First argument : process name
    MESSAGE="$2"                  # Second argument : detailed message
    echo "$MESSAGE" | mail -s "$SUBJECT"  "$ALERT_EMAIL"
}
#Subject: Process Alert: nginx
#Body: Process nginx was down. Restarting...
#Sent to: admin@example.com

# Function: check CPU/memory usage

#$1 = the first argument passed to the function (process name, e.g., nginx).
#pgrep -x "$PROCESS" finds the PID of the process with exact name match.
#process grep, -x finds the exact substring(eg: ssh, sshd it will only look for ssh)
#head -n 1 : if multiple processes match, just take the first PID
#-n checks if the PID string is not empty.
#ps -p "$PID" : Tells ps to only show info for the process with that PID.
# -o %cpu= (-o is output format, %cpu shows the cpu percentage, = removes the header line i.e "CPU") 
#Example Output: 2025-09-03 17:40:12 - Resource usage for nginx (PID 1234): CPU=0.5% MEM=1.2%
