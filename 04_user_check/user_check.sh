# ./systeminfo.sh trump (Script can be executed in this way)
#-z is used to check whether string is empty
#-q quiet mode(no output just sets the exit code)
#"^$USER:" ensures it matches only at the start of the line, followed by a colon
#last -n 1 "$USER" â†’ shows only the most recent login entry.
#the option -F sets the field separator on : (trump:x:1001:1001:Donald Trump:/home/trump:/bin/bash). As each field is seperated by colon.
#Default field seperator it will consider tabs/spaces
